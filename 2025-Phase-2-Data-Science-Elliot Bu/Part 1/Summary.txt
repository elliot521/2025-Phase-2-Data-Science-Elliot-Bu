In this notebook, I conducted exploratory data analysis and preprocessing on the store sales dataset. I began by examining the structure and types of variables, converting date fields as necessary and noting that the “Country” column remained constant across all records. Data cleaning involved removing duplicate entries, clipping extreme outliers, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables for model input. 

Through visualizations such as histograms and boxplots, I analyzed the distributions of sales, profit, quantity, and discount, revealing a skew in sales and negative profits in some cases. A correlation heatmap showed a weak positive relationship between sales and profit, and a moderate negative correlation between discount and profit—an expected outcome.
